# read dataset (a.txt)

# find ratios of each

# sort by ratios

# create a tree with the left most side not including anything and the rightmost side including everything in order of highest ratio things.

#prune tree to remove branches that are higher than capacity 'C'.

# go down all the way the right side and find your tempMax

# backtrack and see if the fractional knapsack of the next node is higher than tempMax. if it is, go down that branch. If not, backtrack again.
